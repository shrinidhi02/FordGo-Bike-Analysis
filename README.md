The data analyzed below is of February 2019. 
    * The source of the data is udacity.The dataset has 16 columns and 1,83,412 rows, which means approximately 1,83,000 rides were made during that month.
    * The original columns of the data set are as follows:

        * duration_sec: duration for which bike is rented in seconds

        * start_station_id: Station ID from where the bike was rented
        * start_station_name: Station name from where the bike was rented
        * start_station_latitude: Latitude of the station from where the bike was rented
        * start_station_longitude: Longitude of the station from where the bike was rented
        * end_station_id: Station ID where the bike was dropped
        * end_station_name: Station name where the bike was dropped
        * end_station_latitude: Latitude of the station where the bike was dropped
        * end_station_longitude: Longitude of the station where the bike was dropped

**Questions analyzed are as follows:**

1. At what time of the week, the demand for the bike is at the peak? On an average for how much time do they ride the bike?
2. At what time of the day there are maximum number of riders? On an average for how much time do they ride the bike?
3. How much percentage of the riders are subscribers and how much percentage of them are customers?
<br>Note: riders can either be subscribers or they can rent it on adhoc basis and they are called customers
4. How does the rental trend look like for different users?
5. Which are the most popular pick up and drop off stations?

**Limitations:**

* The data analyzed is only for one month. Demand for bike is largely impacted by the weather mainly rain, heat and cold. Rain is the most adverse weather for riding bikes. Hence, it might be a good idea to have the weather data along with this.
